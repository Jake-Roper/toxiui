## Development workflow
### Use the `development` branch
The `stable` branch should be updated only every big (non-beta) release, so that we have a reference.

‚ö†Ô∏è **2023-07-15:** Moving the release CI to `development` branch. `stable` will only be used as a reference point, but even then not sure if needed with the amount of commits we have nowadays.

### Pull requests only
‚õîÔ∏è Please do not push code to the `stable` or `development` branches and only use Pull Requests.

### Commit messages
![Emoji Log Extension](https://i.imgur.com/wfC95MH.png)

We use a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension called **Emoji Log** for commit messages.
This is so that [#üì¶git-feed](https://discord.com/channels/769550106948141086/797585103278571551) is readable and easy to understand.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Commits including `TEST:` will be exluded from the changelog in #build-releases
